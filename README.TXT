This is my Waiting List Program.

This is a program that uses Java Queue and Set interfaces to create a system
that manages a waiting list for a service and ensures no duplicate entries.

This program will simulate a waiting list for a service (in my case, a doctors office).
The program uses a Queue to manage the order of people in the waiting list, and a Set to ensure
that no person is added to the waiting list more than once.

In order to use it, first go to the Main class and run it. It will then display a
Menu giving you the option to add a person to your wait list, serve a person, find a person
in the list, get a total number of people waiting, display the waiting list, or quit the 
application. You will then enter in an option number depending on what you would like to do.
